code:
  - raku -e 'say 0.1 + 0.2'
  - raku -e 'say (0.1 + 0.2).fmt(\"%.17f\")'
  - raku -e 'say 1/10 + 2/10'
  - raku -e 'say 0.1e0 + 0.2e0'
result: 
  - 0.3
  - 0.30000000000000000
  - 0.3
  - 0.30000000000000004

[Raku uses rationals by default][1], so `.1` is stored something like `{
numerator => 1, denominator => 10 }`. To actually trigger the behavior, you must
force the numbers to be of type Num (double in C terms) and use the base
function instead of the `sprintf` or `fmt` functions (since those functions have
a bug that limits the precision of the output).
