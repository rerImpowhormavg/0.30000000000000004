Pyret has built-in support for both rational numbers and floating points.
Numbers written normally are assumed to be exact. In contrast, RoughNums are
represented by floating points, and are written prefixed with a `~`, indicating
that they are not precise answers â€“ the `~` is meant to visually evoke
hand-waving. A user who sees a computation produce `~0.30000000000000004` knows
to treat the value with skepticism. RoughNums cannot be compared directly for
equality; they can only be compared up to a given tolerance.
