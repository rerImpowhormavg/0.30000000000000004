Pyret has built-in support for both rational numbers
and floating points. Numbers written
normally are assumed to be exact. In contrast,
*RoughNums* are represented by floating
points, and are written with
a <code>~</code> in front, to indicate that
they are not precise answers. (The
<code>~</code> is meant to visually evoke hand-waving.)
Therefore, a user who sees a computation
produce <code>~0.30000000000000004</code>
knows to treat the value with skepticism.
RoughNums also cannot be compared directly for equality;
they can only be compared up to a given tolerance.
