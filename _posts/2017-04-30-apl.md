[APL][1] has a default [printing precision of 10 significant digits][2]. Setting `⎕PP` to 17 shows the error, however `0.3 = 0.1 + 0.2` is still true (`1`) because there's a default [comparison tolerance of about 10<sup>-14</sup>][3]. Setting `⎕CT` to 0 shows the inequality. [Dyalog APL][4] also supports 128-bit decimal numbers (activated by setting the float representation, `⎕FR`, to 1287, i.e. 128-bit decimal), where even setting the decimal comparison tolerance (`⎕DCT`) to zero still makes the equation hold true.
