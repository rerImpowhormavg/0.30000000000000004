title: "Perl 6"
code:
  - "perl6 -e 'say 0.1+0.2'"
  - "perl6 -e 'say (0.1+0.2).base(10, 17)'"
  - "perl6 -e 'say 1/10+2/10'"
  - "perl6 -e 'say (0.1.Num + 0.2.Num).base(10, 17)'"
result: 
  - 0.3
  - 0.30000000000000000
  - 0.3
  - 0.30000000000000004

[Perl 6, unlike Perl 5, uses rationals by default, so .1 is stored something like { numerator => 1, denominator => 10 }](http://doc.perl6.org/type/Rational).  To actually trigger the behavior, you must force the numbers to be of type Num (double in C terms) and use the base function instead of the sprintf or fmt functions (since those functions have a bug that limits the precision of the output).
